# Agent Participation Guidelines

- Harmony agents must only join a chat conversation after a user explicitly @ mentions them (e.g., `@DistributionLeadAgent`).
- When updating seed data, ensure every agent response is preceded by a user message that includes the matching @ mention.
- Review new conversations with the validation script in `src/data/harmonyChats.json` tooling before committing data changes.
